Morning!👋 This is first practice assignment made for the course "Blockchain and decentralized Technologies"
Implemented using concole interface and python v 3.9.5
All three tasks included in one file
Brute force realised strictly according to the formal criteria given in the description.
Wanted to make separate c++ file to achieve better results in speed, though understood that the initial idea is not usable at all.
Enjoy)😁😎👨‍💻
